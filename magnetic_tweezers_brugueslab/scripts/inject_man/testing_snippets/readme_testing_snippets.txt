!! Code in this folder is not primarily written to be easily usable.

Folder _testing_snippets holds scripts, notebooks and files used for testing the behavior of the code next to and below the folder.
Testing is typically done quickly and is meant as a help when developing. So the code in this folder is typically not necessarily
well documented, organized or in general written for further use.
